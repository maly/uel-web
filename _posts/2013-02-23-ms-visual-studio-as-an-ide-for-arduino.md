Why not? The [VisualMicro plugin](https://www.visualmicro.com/) for Microsoft Visual Studio allows an Arduino project (with code completion) to be developed, compiled and then uploaded to any Arduino micro-processor. This plugin works with full MS Visual Studio, but don&#8217;t worry &#8211; you can get MSVS legally for 3 years, and [here is more about this offer](https://www.visualmicro.com/page/Offer-Visual-Studio-Professional-Free-For-3-Years.aspx). Arduino for Visual Studio is a free Arduino development alternative that provides 100% compatibility with the Arduino programming IDE 0023, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 (1.5 coming soon). Unlike other Arduino plugins, this plugin ensures compatibility with all arduino open source projects. The plugin brings the same ease of programming to Visual Studio that is provided by the Arduino IDE. It&#8217;s really easy to use and very stable! (_from VisualMicro page__)_
