There are a lot of space for tiny [PC](http://www.youtube.com/user/choudhury2011) &#8211; not bloated with all these HDDs, big graphic cards etc., just with small fast processor, FLASH memory, HDMI and a few USB. I bet you know Raspberry Pi. Here is another concept called Android PC &#8211; APC.

<!--more-->

You can buy two APCs &#8211; an older one, named [APC8750](http://apc.io/products/8750a/), and newer one, called [APC Rock](http://apc.io/products/rock). Both are very cheap, for 49, resp. 79 USD. The older one is powered by 800MHz VIA ARM processor, supported with 512MB DDR3 and 2GB FLASH, running Android 2.3 OS. APC Rock rocks with 800MHz VIA ARM Cortex-A9 CPU, 512MB DDR3, 4GB FLASH, better resolution (up to 1080p) and Android 4 OS.

Both of them provides connectors for SD card, VGA, HDMI, two USB, 10/100 LAN and audio output.

(And, of course, that paper&#8230; Yes, here it is: [APC Paper](http://apc.io/products/paper/).)
