_(From NXP&#8217;s newsletter) _

NXP’s LPC800 is the first microcontroller to combine the flexibility of an 8-bit MCU with the versatility of a 32-bit Cortex M0+ core. This is a bold move towards making 8-bit architectures obsolete! That is why we are offering you the opportunity to win an LPC800 mini-board so you can try it for yourself.

We have a limited number of mini-boards using the DIP8-housed LPC810, so we are holding a raffle to give everyone a fair chance of winning one. [Simply watch this short video and answer a couple of questions](https://www.nxp.com/campaigns/lpc800-go/raffle?cid=integrated_initialinvite-mail_email-03_04_13&elq=222520c570114964bf6bdb2403bba4c8) and enter to win.
