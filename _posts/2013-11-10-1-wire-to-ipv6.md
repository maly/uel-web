[1-Wire bus](https://www.uelectronics.info/backup/tags/1-wire.html) is really interesting piece of electronic design by Dallas Semiconductor. It provides two-way serial connection on 1 wire (technically two, of course &#8211; don&#8217;t forget the common ground). There are a lot of devices use 1-Wire interface, from simple thermometers to ID buttons with memory. Fredrik Lindberg  shows how to make an [1-Wire bus master device which can communicate through IPv6](http://www.shapeshifter.se/2009/07/10/1-wire-meets-ipv6/). His device is based on an [Atmel AVR ATmega644](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=ATmega644P%20Automotive) and the [ENC28J60](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en022889) Ethernet controller from Microchip. With this you can address your 1-Wire devices through Ethernet connection.
