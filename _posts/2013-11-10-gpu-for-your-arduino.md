James Bowman is a creator of [first Gameduino](https://www.uelectronics.info/backup/gameduino-arduino-game-adapter.html). This time is his [Gameduino (version 2)](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2084212109/gameduino-2-this-time-its-personal) based on a [FTDI chip FT800 EVE](https://www.ftdichip.com/EVE.htm) (instead of Xilinx FPGA), which provides a full featured OpenGL-like GPU for TFT touch displays, connected through I2C/SPI interface. James added some &#8220;bijou&#8221;, like an accelerometer, SD card slot and sound output.
