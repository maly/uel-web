[Â EasyEDA](http://easyeda.com/) is an EDA, schematic capture, spice circuit simulation and PCB layout designer in one online tool. Not first, [we&#8217;ve seen it before](https://www.uelectronics.info/2013/04/19/design-pcbs-in-your-browser-with-circuits-io/ "Design PCBs in your browser with Circuits.io"). But EasyEDA provides full cycle, from idea and schematic through simulation to PCB design and manufacturing. You can use a rich library of circuits, you can share your design as well as export / import data.
