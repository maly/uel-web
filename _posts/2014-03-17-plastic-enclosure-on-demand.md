A time ago I saw Phil Ruston&#8217;s case for his V6Z80P, and it&#8217;s [awesome](http://www.retroleum.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/acrylic_case.jpg). It&#8217;s cutted from 3mm acrylic and looks just perfect. Fortunatelly Phil wrote who made it: [Razorlab](http://www.razorlab.co.uk/). You select a material (from cardboard to acrylic) and upload your design &#8211; they cut and engrave final piece. You can draw your design in AI, Corel Draw or Inkscape very simple &#8211; blue line is cut, red line is engrave (and don&#8217;t worry, [Razorlab has an extensive manual](http://www.razorlab.co.uk/need-help/getting-started/illustrator/)). So it looks like there is no reason to leave your designs bare. ðŸ˜‰
