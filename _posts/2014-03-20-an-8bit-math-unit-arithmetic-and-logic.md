Based on ATmega169, [this ALU](https://jayakody2000lk.blogspot.cz/2014/03/atmega169-base-8bit-arithmetic-and.html) can provide services like the old 74181 etc. You can do a lot of math operations with two 8bit numbers. It&#8217;s designed for ATmega, but source code is MIT licensed, therefore it should work on PICs etc.
