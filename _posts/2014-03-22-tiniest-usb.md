USB implemented on an ATtiny10? Impossible&#8230; ATtiny10 has only 1kB FLASH, 32 bytes SRAM and reduced register set! Oh&#8230; wait&#8230; look at [µ-Wire](http://cpldcpu.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/%C2%B5-wire-usb-on-an-attiny-10/) – it&#8217;s USB on an ATtiny 10! It shows ATtiny10 is more than sophisticated LED blinker! Great work, anyway&#8230;
