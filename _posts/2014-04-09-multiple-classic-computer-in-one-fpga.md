Multiple Classic Computer (aka [MCC](http://mcc-home.com/2.html)) is simple FPGA (Altera) based design with PS/2 mouse and keyboard and VGA / TV output. It can emulate Commodore C64 and Amiga 500, as well as Apple II, ZX Spectrum and Atari 2600. It provides &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; concept. Games and architecture emulator are stored on SD card.[<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-348" alt="" src="https://www.uelectronics.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wsb_394x296_MCC_216_webpage-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.uelectronics.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wsb_394x296_MCC_216_webpage-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.uelectronics.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wsb_394x296_MCC_216_webpage.jpg 394w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](https://www.uelectronics.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wsb_394x296_MCC_216_webpage.jpg)
