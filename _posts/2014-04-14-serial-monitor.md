&#8220;Sometimes I needed an external serial monitor like the Serial Monitor in the Arduino Editor, to see what is going on. So I made one,&#8221; author said. [ESM (External Serial Monitor)](http://www.instructables.com/id/ESM-ExternalSerialMonitor/) is based on Atmega 328. It has its own display and control buttons, so it can work fully autonomously.
