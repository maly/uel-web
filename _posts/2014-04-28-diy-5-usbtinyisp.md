Author says: &#8220;Over the summer I needed to find a way to get OFF of the arduino board and onto smaller/cheaper microcontrollers for more permanent projects.  
For a while I have been using the ArduinoISP sketch to upload files, but if I wanted to upload a hex file, I needed a real programmer. So I looked at adafruit&#8217;s USBTinyISP, which I must say, was VERY cheap comparing to Atmel&#8217;s other programmers. As cheap as it was, it was $22; I don&#8217;t spend $22 on one thing, so, let me get started on [how to make your own usbtinyisp](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-5-USBTinyISP/).&#8221;
