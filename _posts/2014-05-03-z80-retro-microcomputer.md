Imagine a Z80 CPU at 128MHz, 64MB RAM, monitor, UART, powered by CP/M version 2.2 or MP/M-II&#8230; Just a nice dream? No, it&#8217;s real! Of course, it&#8217;s FPGA. Xilinx Spartan 6 this time, as used in Papilio Pro board. Look at [socz80 project page](https://sowerbutts.com/socz80/)Â for more details and source codes.
