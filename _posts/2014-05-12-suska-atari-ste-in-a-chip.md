Another &#8220;Retrocomp in a FPGA&#8221; approach, this time for Atari ST(E): [Suska](http://www.experiment-s.de/en/). Based on Altera FPGA, boosted by a lot of circuits (Memories, some ATmegas, Ethernet chip&#8230;) You can build your own, or simply [buy ready made board](http://shop.inventronik.de/store/1). Author says: &#8220;At the very beginning it was just the address decoder of the <span class="caps">GLUE</span> custom chip which was replaced by a simple model. That was back in February 2003. Many hundreds of hours later all custom chips found in the Atari <acronym title="E"><span class="caps">ST</span></acronym> have been replaced with a single <span class="caps">FPGA</span>. Even the **68000 <span class="caps">CPU</span>** has been integrated.&#8221;
