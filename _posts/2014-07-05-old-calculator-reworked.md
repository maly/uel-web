A time ago I wrote [an article about old calculators](https://www.uelectronics.info/backup/pocket-pc-challenge.html). My goal is: It should be easy to build a remake with contemporary processors. Here is some of them:

<!--more-->

[Reversing Sinclair calculator](http://files.righto.com/calculator/sinclair_scientific_simulator.html). Great article with an emulator.

[TI calculator](http://files.righto.com/calculator/TI_calculator_simulator.html), with emulator too.

[Build a replica](http://www.simpleavr.com/msp430-projects/tms0803-5-emulating-calculator-build) of a TMS0803-based calculator.
