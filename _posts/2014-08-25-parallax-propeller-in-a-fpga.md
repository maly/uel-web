Parallax opens [Propeller design as Verilog source code](https://www.parallax.com/microcontrollers/propeller-1-open-source).Â <span style="color: #000000;">The Propeller 1 (P8X32A) is now a 100% open multicore microcontroller, including all of the hardware and tools: Verilog code, Spin interpreter, PropellerIDE and SimpleIDE programming tools, and compilers. The Propeller 1 may be the most open chip in its class. Here is a <a href="https://pub.syso.name/P8X32A-on-FPGA/">live demo</a>.</span>
