Mix an old-fashioned 65C02 with the modern octacore Propeller, and you get a [Propeddle](http://www.propeddle.com/).

There is a real 65C02 processor and a real Static RAM chip in the circuit, but a Parallax Propeller determines how the 65C02 &#8220;sees&#8221; its environment, and also helps with tasks that are relatively difficult to implement in hardware, such as video. And it&#8217;s fully open source available for [download](https://github.com/jacgoudsmit/Propeddle).
