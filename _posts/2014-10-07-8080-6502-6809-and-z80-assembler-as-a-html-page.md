I made a little spin-off of [ASM80 IDE](https://www.asm80.com). You can use the compiler locally, offline, in a simple way.

Visit [asm8080](https://www.asm80.com/onepage/asm8080.html), [asm6502](https://www.asm80.com/onepage/asm6502.html), [asm6809](https://www.asm80.com/onepage/asm6809.html) or [asmZ80](https://www.asm80.com/onepage/asmz80.html). You can save these files to your PC (Ctrl S, or right click to the link and Save as&#8230;)

Usage is really simple: Just open the HTML file in your browser. Copy and paste the source code into a Source window and press Compile.

And yes, it provides [all features of the &#8220;full&#8221; ASM80](https://www.uelectronics.info/2014/03/30/asm80-description/ "ASM80 description").
