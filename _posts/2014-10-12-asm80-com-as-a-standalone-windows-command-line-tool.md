Just a small update &#8211; if you want to use [ASM80 assembler](https://www.asm80.com) as a command-line utility, [grab your installer here](https://www.asm80.com/install/asm80-setup.exe).

Usage is really simple: Install, open your console and type &#8220;asmÂ _file_&#8220;. Or just &#8220;asm&#8221; for brief help.
