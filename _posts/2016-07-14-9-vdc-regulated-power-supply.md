Tiny low current 9 VDC Regulated Power supply designed around bipolar transistor and zener diode. The circuit is known as series voltage regulator or emitter follower voltage regulator. The unregulated supply fed to input and the circuit regulate the voltage and provide constant 9V DC, 250mA. The zener diode providesâ€¦&#013;
