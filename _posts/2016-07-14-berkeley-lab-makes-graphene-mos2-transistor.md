U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has developed a way to assemble transistors based on the 2D materials graphene and molybdenum disulfide. By Peter Clarke @ edn-europe.com The method etches narrow channels in conducting graphene laid down on a silicon-dioxide substrate. These channels are then filled…&#013;
