Perhaps our future overlords won’t be made up of electrical circuits after all but will instead be soft-bodied like ourselves. However, their design will have its origins in electrical analogues, as with the Octobot. The Octobot is the brainchild a team of Harvard University researchers who recently published an article…&#013;
