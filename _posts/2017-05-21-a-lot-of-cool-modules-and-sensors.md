I am buying electronic stuff from AliExpress &#8211; due to the \***\**** custom policy of EU it is a much cheaper than buying from Adafruit, Sparkfun etc. Unfortunatelly. There is a lot of total crap, but also a lot of great stuff too. I am diving into AliExpress three times a week, and I found many pieces &#8220;I really have to build&#8221;. So I decided to share these tips with you and made a new web called [Alitronik](https://alitronik.com).

There are three tips per day at Alitronik, and each sunday is &#8220;[a Funday](https://alitronik.com/category/tips-for-sunday/)&#8221; &#8211; a day for tips with something in common. For example &#8211; [the last one is dedicated to solar power, energy metering, weather stations and lasers](https://alitronik.com/f-is-for-funday-4/). Previous week was in the sign of [Raspberry Pi cases, tools, robots and construction of 8085-based mini PC](https://alitronik.com/f-is-for-funday-3/).

From the recent post I want to mention e.g. [37 sensors kit](https://alitronik.com/37-in-1-sensor-kit-for-arduino-etc/), [CC-A80 Cubieboard PC](https://alitronik.com/cc-a80-cubieboard4-card-mini-pc/), [Speech Recognition Module](https://alitronik.com/non-specific-speech-recognition-module-ld3320/), [LoRa Shield for Arduino](https://alitronik.com/arduino-lora-shield/), [NodeMCU-32S](https://alitronik.com/nodemcu-32s-an-esp32-development-board/) or [SMD Tweezer and multimeter tool](https://alitronik.com/smd-tweezer-with-tester-and-multimeter/).

So &#8211; bookmarkÂ [Alitronik.com](https://alitronik.com), read [Alitronik RSS](https://alitronik.com/feed), follow [@alitronik_tips](https://twitter.com/alitronik_tips), [subscribe weekly digest](http://eepurl.com/cODhwT) or [submit your own tips](https://goo.gl/forms/DWC5Lb7rSGnYzKHe2).
