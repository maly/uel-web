Wanna convert HEX to series of DB? Or binary file to series of DB? Or wanna convert them to the JavaScript Array form? Or you have a LST file and want to convert it to ASM, so trim first 20 (or 16, or 18, or 32) characters? It&#8217;s easy with [the ASM80 Tools](https://www.asm80.com/tools/index.html#/).
